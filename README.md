## My roadmap

I did love and enjoy the key-bindings of vim, from the day I switch from
the emacs, but I switch back shortly because of the 2 main reasons.

1.  Emacs plugins works on my windows but the my vim got some problem
    and I have to dirty my configuration files so much to fixed.
2.  I need to use playframework for development and the emacs support
    ensime very well.

I move from emacs to vim then to neovim and now I am using the
spacemacs, I think the configuration for everyone will become the same
after long period of learning and copying from others, so it is good to
give the community driven software a try.
